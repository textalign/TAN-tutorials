   <!-- EXERCISE 4 -->
   <!-- Reference systems -->
   
   <!-- Background: open the official TAN vocabulary file for division types:
      ../../../TAN-2021/vocabularies/div-types.TAN-voc.xml and browse through the entries.
      Observe the typology, and that there are 160 logical div types compared to only
      12 material div types.
   -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 1: Division types -->
   <!-- List every type of <div> in your TAN-TEI files. For each item, indicate whether the
      division is material or logical. For each file, is the entire reference system material,
      logical, or mixed?
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 2: Reference scriptum -->
   <!-- For each scriptum/source you are transcribing, itemize all the possible reference systems.
      Classify each reference system as material, logical, or mixed. 
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 3: Reference system -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI files, insert toward the beginning of the <head> a <reference-system>,
      filling out the attributes as best you can. Do not worry about @wf-ready, because that
      refers to an experimental technology.
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 4: Reference system -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI files, identify at least one other work that is quoted or alluded to.
      Let's call that a target text. Using plain language, write down at least five references
      to the target text, connecting them to references in your source texts with some verb
      that describes the relationship between the two texts. For example:
         2:4:7 quotes from Matt 2:14
         1.2 parallels VII. 
      You can use any punctuation character you like to separate levels but NOT a comma (which
      always means "and" and creates a sequence).
