   <!-- Congratulations. At this point you should have at least one working TAN-TEI file. If
      you do not yet, then for this exercise you may wish to use t-1-2-ex-2-demo-result.xml for
      the following exercise.
   -->
   
   <!-- EXERCISE 3 -->
   <!-- Exploring TAN normalization -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 1: Unicode -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI file, invoke a validation error by finding some non-normalized Unicode
      characters in the script of your choice and insert them. Use Schematron Quick Fixes to
      normalize the faulty Unicode.
   -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 2: references -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI file, invoke a validation error by inserting a value of a numeric @n in 
      the beginning of the first valid descendant text node. (Note: to raise this error you will 
      need to validate in verbose mode.) Try to repeat the error with different numeration systems:
      Roman, alphabetic.
   -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 3: line endings -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI file, add discretionary hyphens where appropriate. If your text does not 
      require it, try adding one at an appropriate place. Note: the discretionary hyphen is &#xAD; -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 4: normalizations -->
   <!-- In your TAN-TEI file's <head>, just before <vocabulary-key>, add an <adjustments>. Inside
      that, add at least one <normalization> and declare at least one kind of normalization that has
      been performed on the transcription. If you want to use standard, built-in TAN vocabulary, use
      @which (if blank or marked with ???, a Schematron Quick Fix will present you with options).
      Alternatively, you may define your own normalization vocabulary item, either by using <IRI> +
      <name> inside the element, or by defining a vocabulary item either in the <vocabulary-key>
      or in your TAN-voc file.
