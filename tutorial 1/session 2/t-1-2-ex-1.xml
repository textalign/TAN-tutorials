   <!-- Prob. 1: Adjusting a TEI body -->
   <!-- Take one of your TEI files, and convert everything but the <head> to TAN. Observe the following steps,
      using the demonstration as a guide:
      * point to the two TAN-TEI schemas
      * add @TAN-version and @id to the root element; think hard about the tag URN you need to use for the
      value of @id
      * add TAN's <head>, but let it remain empty for now
      * be sure <body> has an @xml:lang
      * make sure your <div>s are set up to reflect the primary reference system you've adopted.
