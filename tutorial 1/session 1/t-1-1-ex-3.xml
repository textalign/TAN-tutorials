         <desc>The Story of Sinuhe (also known as Sanehat)[2] is considered one of the finest works
            of ancient Egyptian literature. It is a narrative set in the aftermath of the death of
            Pharaoh Amenemhat I, founder of the 12th Dynasty of Egypt, in the early 20th century BC.
            It was composed around 1875 BC, although the earliest extant manuscript is from the
            reign of Amenemhat III, c. 1800 BC.[3] There is an ongoing debate among Egyptologists as
            to whether or not the tale is based on actual events involving an individual named
            Sinuhe (Egyptian: Za-Nehet "son of the sycamore"),[4] with the consensus being that it
            is most likely a work of fiction.[5][6] Due to the universal nature of the themes
            explored in Sinuhe, including divine providence and mercy, its anonymous author has been
            described as the "Egyptian Shakespeare" whose ideas have parallels in biblical texts.
            Sinuhe is considered to be a work written in verse and it may also have been
            performed.[7] The great popularity of the work is witnessed by the numerous surviving
            fragments.[8]</desc>
