   <!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
   <!-- Prepare the network -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 1: exposing your files to the network -->
   <!-- Use the TAN-TEI files you prepared from session 2 and add <master-location>s to each one, pointing to
      a location on the Internet where you can post the material. Once it is valid, upload the file to the
      target location. Confirm that you have done this by validating your local file. There should be no errors
      at <master-location>. Try adding a character or two in local file. Validate again. You should get a 
      validation warning that reports exactly where the difference occurs.
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 2: accessing the network -->
   <!-- Share the master-location with others who are taking this tutorial. They will be sharing their links
      with you as well. Find one or two files from each of two or more of your fellow participants, get a copy
      of the files, and put them in your local TAN file system. Validate the files. Does <master-location> 
      validate? Try adding a little bit of text to your local copy, and validate again. Results? Tell participants
      which files you have accessed.
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 3: communicating to the network -->
   <!-- If you have been told by one of your fellow participants that they are using your file, add at least 
      one <comment> or <change>. Post the new copy to the master location. Make sure your file validates. Ask
      your fellow participant to validate their local copy. They should see the new comment or change that you
      have added.
   -->
   
   
   <!-- Prob. 4: align the file -->
   <!-- Choose one of the files you have downloaded from your fellow participants and add it as a <source> 
      to the TAN-A file you created in the previous exercise. Within that element, add a <location> pointing
      to the local copy and another <location> to the master location. Validate your TAN-A file. What do you 
      see?
