   <!-- Configure aliases for Parabola -->
   
   <!-- Prob. 1: aliases -->
   <!-- Create an <alias> in the <vocabulary-key> that points to two different alias ids. Then define two
      more <alias>es to define those, and let them point to the source @xml:ids, so that all sources are
      covered. Make sure that they are all versions of the same work. Run Parabola to check your results. -->
